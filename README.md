# Overview
Machine Learning robot I am building using python. I am going to analyze how student's test scores are affected based off of their Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preperation course. The dataset I will be pulling from is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977) and consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows.

# Life cycle of a Machine Learning Project

* Data Pre-Processing
* Model Training
* Evaluate model
* Push model

# Imported Data and Required Packages
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import batplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
