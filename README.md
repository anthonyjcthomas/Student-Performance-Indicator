Machine Learning robot I am building using python. I am going to analyze how student's test scores are affected based off of their Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preperation course. The dataset I will be pulling from is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977) and consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows.
